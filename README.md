# Udacity Reinforcement
Reinforcement implementation of udacitys self-driving car simulation:
https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim
Coding changes are in the Assets/1_SelfDrivingCar/Scripts folder
As well as this, there are some cosmetic changes, including adding a road divider between two separate roads
Though the changes i've made are poorly annotated, as this is proof of the coding that i've done for the masters thesis
